The required **🔋 Stamina** is depends on the chosen **👊 Training** method.

A quick **📝 Note**: You need **🔋 Stamina** to attend **⚔ Fights**.

---

### **⚔ Fight** —

**⚔ Fight** is simple, if you **K.O.** your opponent. You will **🏆 Win**. if your opponent **K.O.** you, then you will **☠ Lose**. If both of you are **K.O.** at same turn, then the winner will be the fighter who inflicted more **💥 Damage** to the opponent.

To **🏆 Win**, you have **8 options** (for now):

| **🥊 Attack**         | **🛡 Guards**     |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- |
| **👊 Jab**            | **🛡 Head Guard** |
| **👊 Straight**       | **🛡 Body Guard** |
| **🤜 Left Hook**      |
| **🤛 Right Hook**     |
| **✊ Left Uppercut**  |
| **✊ Right Uppercut** |

While **🥊 Attack** cost **🔋 Stamina**. **🛡 Guards** cost **nothing**. But **DO NOT FORGET**, in a draw case, the winner will be the fighter, who inflicted more **💥 Damage** to the opponent. Regarding that, **don't try to play 100% defensive.**
